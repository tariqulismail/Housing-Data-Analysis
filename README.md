# Cleaning the Housing Dataset using pl/SQL.

This repository showcases a collection of data analysis projects designed to highlight the skills and expertise of a data analyst. Each project encompasses the entire data analysis process, from data acquisition and cleaning to exploratory data analysis and visualization. The repository serves as a comprehensive portfolio, demonstrating the ability to extract meaningful insights from data and translate them into actionable recommendations.



# What was done?
1️⃣ Converting String Date to Date datatype was the first task on my list. This ensured consistency and efficiency in handling date-related queries.

2️⃣ Updating missing values in the Address Column was crucial for the dataset's completeness. By filling in these gaps, we improved the overall quality of the information.

3️⃣ Breaking out PropertyAddress and Owner Address into individual columns made the data more organized and easier to work with. This separation allowed for better analysis and visualization of the property and owner details.

4️⃣ Changing 'Y' and 'N' to 'Yes' and 'No' in the 'SoldAsVacant' field provided clarity and improved the dataset's readability.

5️⃣ Removing duplicates and redundant columns streamlined the dataset, eliminating unnecessary information and reducing clutter.
